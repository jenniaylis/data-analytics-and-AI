# What I learned in this course?

I learned Python. (I hadn't used much Python before these exercises.)

I learned how to group and organize data, how to add/calculate new values to the existing dataframes but also how to filter data not wanted.

# How to run these pieces of code?

To run some of the python code I downloaded Jupyter extension to my Visual Studio Code.
Then just clicked "run code".
